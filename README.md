Ties in with the new addition in the "Cloverfield" film series.

//Technology Used:

HTML,CSS,JQUERY

//User Story:

The game is purposefully designed to offer very little instruction for the user.
The idea is that the user figures out the solution themselves. Primarily through 
trial and error.

Using the clues provided and clues discovered along the way the user discovers 
the correct password for the login input.

//Improvements:

I would add a little more style. Make it look more rugged. Like a web version of a crumpled up piece of paper.
I would like to expand on the clues a bit more.
